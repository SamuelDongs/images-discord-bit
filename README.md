# Sapphire Images
Sapphire Images allows you to upload images and get URLs that permanently point to these images right within Discord.

Images uploaded to Discord get a new image link every few weeks since Feburary 2024.

This means that images uploaded to Discord can no longer be used as Moderation proof. Sapphire Images aims to fix that.
